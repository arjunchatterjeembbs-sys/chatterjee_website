Outside of medicine, these are the passions that keep me grounded and energized.  
They add color to my days, inspiration to my routines, and balance to my life.

## **Sports**

I’ve been a lifelong Manchester United football club fan, and following the English Premier League has become a weekly ritual. Whether it’s catching a late-night match, debating tactics with friends, or celebrating a big win, sports give me a sense of excitement and community no matter how busy training gets. It’s my way to disconnect, recharge, and stay connected to something I’ve loved since childhood.

## **Music**

Music is woven into every stage of my life — whether I’m editing videos, traveling, or winding down after a long call. My playlists range widely: EDM for energy (huge AVICII fan), Indian and Bengali classics for nostalgia, and everything in between for the moments that need their own soundtrack. Music helps me reflect, reset, and keep a sense of rhythm through the ups and downs of clinical life.

## **Photography**

Photography is where I slow down. Between travel, long weekend walks, and spontaneous adventures, I enjoy capturing the small details and fleeting moments that often go unnoticed. Photos help me remember where I’ve been, who I met along the way, and the simple beauty hidden in everyday life.  

It’s not about perfect shots — it’s about collecting stories.
