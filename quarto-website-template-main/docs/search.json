    "text": "Pancreatic Cysts, IPMN Surveillance & Early Cancer Detection\n\nFull publication\nMy second major project centers on intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and the challenge of predicting which cysts will progress to high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.\nAcross population-based datasets and multicenter clinical cohorts, I have contributed to studies assessing:\n\nthe natural history of IPMNs\n\nlong-term outcomes after surveillance\n\nrisk factors for early-stage PDAC detection\n\npredictors of malignant transformation\n\nopportunities for integrating clinical, imaging, and biomarker data\n\nThis work aims to guide clinicians toward more informed decisions about surveillance intervals, surgical referral, and high-risk patient identification. Ultimately, the goal is to help move the field toward earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, when it is most treatable."

My work sits at the intersection of clinical pancreatology, advanced endoscopy, and outcomes-driven research — shaped by early training at the Mayo Clinic, where I served as a Research Fellow in Gastroenterology.\nMy academic mission is simple: to contribute meaningful, practice-changing evidence in pancreatic disease, with a focus on early detection, high-risk syndromes, procedural innovation, and health-services research. I am deeply engaged in pancreas-focused scholarship: from leading projects in fatty pancreas disease, IPMN surveillance, recurrent pancreatitis, and biliary/pancreatic endoscopy, to presenting at national societies including ACG, DDW, APA, and PancreasFest.\nI have been honored to receive multiple recognitions, including selection as a CAPER Pancreas Scholar (2024–26), the CAPER/NPF Visiting Fellowship at UPMC, ACG Presidential Poster Awards, Cleveland Clinic IM Research Award, and multiple National Pancreas Foundation Travel Scholarships. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for the ACG Case Reports Journal and as an #EBGI Social Media Ambassador, reflecting my parallel interest in medical communication and education.\nBeyond research, I enjoy creating and sharing educational content through Medical Twitter and YouTube, running my long-standing platform “Curious Cranium”, mentoring international medical trainees, and building digital tools — including websites, video content, and graphics that make complex ideas more accessible.\nMy long-term goal is to become a clinician-scientist and educator in medical pancreatology, advancing early diagnosis, risk prediction, and minimally invasive therapeutics for pancreatic disease — while contributing to the next generation of trainees through education, scholarship, and mentorship.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

Whether it’s catching a late-night match, debating tactics with friends, or celebrating a big win, sports give me a sense of excitement and community no matter how busy training gets. It’s my way to disconnect, recharge, and stay connected to something I’ve loved since childhood."

My playlists range widely: EDM for energy (huge AVICII fan), Indian and Bengali classics for nostalgia, and everything in between for the moments that need their own soundtrack. Music helps me reflect, reset, and keep a sense of rhythm through the ups and downs of clinical life."

Between travel, long weekend walks, and spontaneous adventures, I enjoy capturing the small details and fleeting moments that often go unnoticed. Photos help me remember where I’ve been, who I met along the way, and the simple beauty hidden in everyday life.\nIt’s not about perfect shots — it’s about collecting stories."
