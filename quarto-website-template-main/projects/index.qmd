This project focuses on **fatty pancreas disease (FPD)** — an increasingly recognized yet understudied entity with important implications for long-term pancreatic health.  
Using a large US multicenter matched cohort, our team evaluated how radiologic pancreatic steatosis influences future risks of **pancreatitis**, **pancreatic exocrine dysfunction**, and **pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)**.

The findings highlight that FPD is not merely an incidental imaging finding but a potential **early marker of future pancreatic disease**.  
This work represents one of the most comprehensive evaluations of FPD outcomes to date, and serves as the foundation for ongoing efforts to define diagnostic criteria, understand metabolic contributors, and develop risk-stratification tools for clinical practice.

## Pancreatic Cysts, IPMN Surveillance & Early Cancer Detection

My second major project centers on **intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)** and the challenge of predicting which cysts will progress to high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.  
Across population-based datasets and multicenter clinical cohorts, I have contributed to studies assessing:

- the **natural history** of IPMNs  
- long-term outcomes after surveillance  
- risk factors for **early-stage PDAC** detection  
- predictors of malignant transformation  
- opportunities for integrating clinical, imaging, and biomarker data  

This work aims to guide clinicians toward more informed decisions about surveillance intervals, surgical referral, and high-risk patient identification. Ultimately, the goal is to help move the field toward **earlier detection of pancreatic cancer**, when it is most treatable.
